Put my introduction here, why should you care about this

## Key Concepts

Introduction to a couples of key concepts here (CPUs, CPU bound, I/O bound, etc). Non-blocking

- Parallelism

## Asyncronous Programming in Python

NOTE: We won't cover legacy asyncronous programming in Python, in the interest of time

- Async/await syntax (native coroutines)

- Coroutine function vs coroutine object

- Will skip generator based coroutines

- Coroutine is a generator, but a generator is not a coroutine
